Analysis Project: Fitness Tracker Data Analysis

This repository contains an analysis project that focuses on exploring and analyzing fitness tracker data. The project utilizes Python and various data analysis libraries to perform data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis on the fitness tracker dataset.

Dataset

The analysis project uses the Fitabase Data, which includes data collected from fitness trackers worn by individuals. The dataset consists of multiple files, including daily activity data, sleep data, and hourly steps data. These files are merged and used for the analysis.

Analysis Steps

The project follows the following steps:

Data Loading and Cleaning: The fitness tracker data is loaded into Python using Pandas. Data cleaning operations such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and renaming columns are performed.

Exploratory Data Analysis: The cleaned data is analyzed to gain insights into various aspects of fitness activities, sleep patterns, and step counts. Visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore relationships and patterns in the data.

Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis is conducted to derive meaningful conclusions from the data. Summary statistics, averages, and correlations are calculated to understand the relationships between different variables.

User Classification: Users are classified into different user types based on their daily activity levels. The classification is done using predefined thresholds for daily steps.

Visualization: The analysis results are visualized using different types of charts, including bar plots, pie charts, scatter plots, and box plots. These visualizations help in presenting the findings and making them more interpretable.

Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
Seaborn: For enhanced data visualizations.

Please ensure that these libraries are installed in your Python environment before running the analysis.

Usage

To run the analysis project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/dn9527/DataAnalyst-Capstone-Project.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for the analysis.
Modify the file paths or configurations if necessary to match your local environment.
Execute the code cells or run the script to perform the analysis.
Review the generated visualizations and analysis results.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your requirements and data.
